#### About me

After graduating in 2016, I started working as a front-end engineer. The process is arduous and challenging.
~~>_<~~First, the major is looking has inconsistencies between the major and the position, most people didn't know digital media technology has a software direction, which we learn is similar to the software engineer, the knowledge I learned in college learning was far away as professional front-end engineer, so I study one's own, which needs the discipline and diligence, and I believe I do it well.
Second, academic qualifications are look as important in China, candidates with good university background are more likely to get interviews and promotion, to avoid those unnecessary impediments, after working for five years, I decide to study for one year master, and I graduated in 2023, I decide to continue my previous working position.

(●'◡'●)So here I've rounded up some of the projects I've worked on before as well as the note I've learned.

For my excellent technology:
╰(*°▽°*)╯╰(*°▽°*)╯I extremly confident with building tech projects in HTML, CSS, React, Redux, and TypeScript is my expertise.  The value is measured in cross-functional collaboration and seamless integration of React components.  Whatever challenge to launching the start-up of a new project or maintaining the old version code, I have achieved results.
I communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring alignment on project objectives and deliverables. Furthermore, I take ownership of my work and thrive on resolving problems independently or collaboratively through open discussions with the team.
